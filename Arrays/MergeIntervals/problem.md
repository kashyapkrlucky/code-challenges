## Merge Intervals

### Description
Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

### Examples
```
Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
```

### Constraints
- Intervals are represented as `[start, end]` where `0 <= start <= end <= 10^4`.
- The input list contains at most `10^4` intervals.
